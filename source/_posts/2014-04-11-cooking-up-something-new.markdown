After an amazing adventure with the great people at Demand Media, I on my way to cook up something new. If the cheesy pun didn't give it away, I will be joining the community team at Chef on April 28th. While I will miss the amazing folks at Demand, I am super excited about the new adventures ahead.

My role at Chef will be working as a Community Software Engineer working to help make the experience of using and contributing to community cookbooks delightful. I am looking forward to working with all the amazing people in our community.

I am looking forward to the new adventures with Chef and the ability to focus on making the lives of others better as I work with people to make it easier to solve problems with cookbooks. The ability to focus on shared and open-source infrastructure code is something I have wanted to do for a long time. This will give me the chance to help encapsulate the years of yak shaving into code that will hopefully let others do more awesome.

Just because I want to explicitly state it, I still have lots of love for Puppet and the folks at Puppet Labs. I am excited to continue to see where the Puppet ecosystem goes. While I for sure have some definite reasons why I like Chef, Puppet is still an amazing tool.

If you are going to be at #ChefConf I will be around all day on Wednesday so hit me up.
