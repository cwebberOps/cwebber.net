Ok, so I am going to just rip the bandaid off... Engineering managers are no different that other management professionals. We as an industry seem to do this thing where we act and believe that leading technical teams is any different than leading any other team of humans.

The worst part is that the immediate reaction to a statement like that is usually about so-called professional managers; the folks that obviously know how to manage ANY team they are handed because they have an MBA. I will be happy when that idea fades from our collective conscious. No matter what the profession, the person leading the team, especially when managing individual contributors (ICs), has to have expertise in the space. They don't need to be experts but they need to be respected to make good decisions and understand the what and why of their team.

Let's look at a few non-tech examples. My goto is always the example of a fast-food restaurant. The manager of a fast-food restaurant has to not only understand all of the jobs that happen in the restaurant, they need to be able to perform them at some basic level. This is not to say they are the best on drive-thru or the best cook, but when the literal bus shows up, they need to be able to step in and help where it is needed. As you get into more complex industries, there becomes less of a need to know how to do the job but instead a deep understanding of what the job is and why it is important. If you are managing an accounting team, you don't need to know all the in's and out's of a persons job, but you better understand the accounting basics and how all the numbers come together.

I guess what I am really trying to say, we need to get past our Not Invented Here syndrome and look around to understand what we can learn from the rest of the world that has been studying this forever.
