I am not sure I would call it a New Year's resolution, but I am reminded that I need to write more, and even more than that, I need to write about the things I don't want to forget a few years from now. So instead of starting with work, I thought I would start with my recent trip to Hawaii. We were gone December 27th, 2018 - January 10th, 2019, staying the first week on Oahu and the second in Kauai.

## Getting There

Probably the best decision we could have made was to stay at the [Residence Inn](http://www.residenceinnlax.com/) near the airport and take the shuttle in. We were close, and it was a simple trek. The only real issue was that I freaked out a bit about security and we left earlier than we needed to, resulting in not getting breakfast.

Once at the airport, things went well-ish. Security was a breeze. Signing up the family for [SENTRI](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri) continues to pay dividends. There is something about not having to add taking off shoes and long lines to the chaos that is the airport. The carseat cover we bought was a bit of a fail. The zipper broke as I was trying to get the carseat back into it after the TSA inspection.

The biggest fail was that the lounge I had planned to visit using Priority Pass was, well, not accepting Priority Pass. This led to a bit of grumpiness since there was no coffee and no way I was going to spend more than $50 to get the family a crappy breakfast. (Later in the trip I found the [Lounge Buddy app](https://www.loungebuddy.com) which was showing something about a Rock 'N Brews Lounge... gonna have to try that next time I fly.)

Once on the flight things went well. I really liked flying Hawaiian Airlines. The service was good and the seat size was decent. The layover in OGG left a bit to be desired, but that was more a function of moving six of us with roll-aboards, a stroller in a bag, and a car seat.

By far the best prep decision I made was to book the rental at the [Pearl City Enterprise Rent-a-Car](https://www.enterprise.com/en/car-rental/locations/us/hi/honolulu-aiea-3605.html) instead of getting it at the airport. It was $1300 vs $2100 for the week and the cost of an Uber ride.

## Week 1: Oahu

In general, Oahu was my favorite of the two islands. The traffic was much less worse than expected. I loved driving all around, whether it was around the island or on the various interstates.

### The Resort

We stayed at [Marriott's Ko Olina Beach Club](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/hnlko-marriotts-ko-olina-beach-club/). The resort was gorgeous. For starters, the beach access was amazing with a beautiful lagoon on the property, with one of the other lagoons visible from our balcony. The lobby, had an awesome feel and seemed mostly outdoors, or at least open to the outside. The pools were also awesome. We didn't use anything but the main pool (there are three) but it was neat. Multi-level, interconnected under bridges, waterfalls, and a good sized slide.

The marketplace was huge and there were a number of restaurants on site and within walking distance. We didn't eat at any of the onsite restaurants. It was all the typical prices with the one fancy restaurant onsite being an itallian restaurant that you didn't get the bonus points for.

[Ko Olina](http://koolina.com/), the larger part of the resort, which is also home to a Four Seasons and Disney's Aulani was spot on. There was a shuttle, that we never ended up using and a number of shops and restaurants. There is a market in Ko Olina Center that was basically ABC Store. It had all sorts of awesome. The food was on point and so was the coffee. Reasonably priced in general. Jamie and I had dinner just the two of us at the Monkey Pod Restaurant. Food was decent but the drinks were well worth it.
